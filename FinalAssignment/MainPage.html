	<p>I think you can guess who this first guy is… that’s right, Santa Claus!
 We all know that Santa brings toys to all the good girls and boys, but why don’t we learn more about the history of Santa Claus? Did you know that Santa didn’t meet Mrs. Claus until 1849? That means that he was a bachelor allllllll of the time before that.</p>

	<p>Next I want to tell you about the mystery of Santa, don’t worry it’s not too spooky. Alright, here we go, we don’t know where Santa Claus lives! Most popularly he is known to live in the North Pole in Alaska, but there are also stories that tell us he is from the most northern part of Finland, in a town called Rovaniemi! And just in case you aren’t sure where Finland is, it’s in Europe. But that doesn’t matter because Santa Claus is from the North Pole!</p>

	<p>…or is he? </p>

	<p>Next, I’m going to tell you a little about Santa’s reindeer, because we all know his sleigh isn’t going anywhere without them! Here are the names of his reindeer, or at least the ones we know: </p>

	<p>Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen. I think that’s it, or is there one I’m forgetting? That’s right!! IT’S <span class="uppercase">Rudolf!!</span> Now here’s some facts about them: </p>

	<p>Blitzen is the <span class="uppercase">fastest</span> reindeer of all! Or maybe that’s Dasher, they’re both very quick on their feet. Or should I say hooves? </p>

	<p>Dancer is so fun to be around because Dancer loves to <span class="uppercase">dance!</span> </p>

	<p>Prancer is super <span class="uppercase">enthusiastic</span> which means being very energetic and happy. I’ve also heard that Prancer likes to bake.</p>

	<p>Rudolph has a very <span class="uppercase">bright</span> nose! I bet you didn’t know that one.</p>

	<p>Vixen likes to <span class="uppercase">joke</span> around and play magic tricks. </p>

	<p>Comet is <span class="uppercase">adorable</span> and a great role model. </p>

	<p>Cupid is very <span class="uppercase">loving</span></p>

	<p>Finally, Donner is the <span class="uppercase">loudest</span> reindeer! </p>

	<p>Well I hope you like my reindeer facts, what should we learn about next?</p>

	<p>The last think we are going to learn about is a Christmas Tree! These are very commonly found in the homes of people who celebrate Christmas, or at least that’s the way it is in Canada where I’m from. Christmas trees come in lots of different sizes and are covered in Christmas decorations, like in the picture above. They also have lots of gifts for Christmas underneath them! Maybe we should learn a little more about this history of Christmas trees… </p>

	<p>Long before the Christmas trees of today, green palms and evergreen boughs were used for certain celebrations and traditions by ancient Egyptians, Romans and even the Vikings in Europe. However, Germany is believed to be the first ones to have Christmas trees more like the ones we have now. Later on, in the United States, in the 1830s, Christmas trees were first displayed by German settlers in Pennsylvania! </p>
